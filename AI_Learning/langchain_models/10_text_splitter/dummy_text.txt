Based on the tools and libraries you mentioned ‚Äî NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and LangChain ‚Äî here's what your AI skill profile suggests:

üîç Your AI Profile Type:
You are a GenAI + Data-Centric AI Engineer (blending Data Science, Generative AI, and AI Application Engineering).

üß† What This Means:
Skill/Tool	Indicates Expertise In
NumPy, Pandas	Data analysis, preprocessing, and numerical computing (core Data Science skills)
Matplotlib	Data visualization (used in EDA, reporting, and ML diagnostics)
LangChain	Generative AI apps, LLM orchestration, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), chatbot development, etc.

üîß You can describe yourself as:
GenAI Engineer | LLM App Developer | AI/ML & Data Science Enthusiast

Or a more detailed version:

GenAI Engineer with experience in LLM frameworks (LangChain), data wrangling (NumPy, Pandas), visualization (Matplotlib), and backend integration using Python frameworks.
If you want to go deeper into Machine Learning, start learning:

Scikit-learn (for classic ML models)

TensorFlow / PyTorch (for deep learning)

Transformers (Hugging Face) (for working directly with LLMs)

Let me know if you want a learning path tailored to GenAI + Data Science.
