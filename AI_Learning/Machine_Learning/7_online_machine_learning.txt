# Definition:
A machine learning approach where the model is trained incrementally, one data point (or a small batch) at a time, as the data arrives. The model updates continuously without needing the entire dataset upfront.

# Key Characteristics

    Incremental Updates: The model learns as new data comes in.

    Real-Time Training: Can adapt to changing data patterns immediately.

    Low Memory Requirement: Only a small portion of data is needed at a time.

    Dynamic Model: The model evolves continuously instead of being static.

#Example

    Chatbot: As users interact, the chatbot updates its responses based on new conversations.

    Recommendation systems: Netflix, Amazon, YouTube – update recommendations as users watch/buy content.

    Stock price prediction: Continuously adjusts to new market data.
