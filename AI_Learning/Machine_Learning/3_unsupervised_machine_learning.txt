1. Clustering

Goal: Group similar data points together based on features.
Output: Clusters or groups.

Algorithms:

    K-Means

    Hierarchical Clustering

    DBSCAN

    Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

Use cases:

    Customer segmentation

    Market basket analysis

    Image segmentation


2/Association

Goal: Find rules or relationships between variables in datasets.

Output: Association rules (e.g., “if A occurs, B likely occurs”)

Algorithms:

    Apriori

    Eclat

    FP-Growth

    Use cases:

    Market basket analysis (Amazon “customers who bought this also bought…”)

    Recommendation systems

3. Dimensionality Reduction

Goal: Reduce the number of features while preserving essential information.

Output: Lower-dimensional representation of the data.

Algorithms:

    Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

    t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

    Autoencoders

    Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Use cases:

    Data visualization

    Noise reduction

    Feature extraction for machine learning

4. Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection)

Goal: Identify unusual or rare data points.

Algorithms:

    Isolation Forest

    One-Class SVM

    DBSCAN (can also detect outliers)

Use cases:

    Fraud detection

    Network intrusion detection

    Fault detection in manufacturing
