Based on Learning Model, ML is classified into two types:

1. Memorizing / Instance-Based Learning

How it works:

    No real "training" or abstract model building.

    The algorithm remembers the data and answers based on similarity to stored examples.

    Behavior: Instant reply when asked, by comparing new data with past data.

Example Algorithm:

    k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

    Locally Weighted Regression

    Key Point: Relies on memory + similarity search.

2. Generalizing / Model-Based Learning

How it works:

    The algorithm actually learns patterns/relationships in the data by creating a model (like a function or set of rules).

    Once trained, the model can generalize and make predictions on new/unseen data.

    Behavior: Learns from the training phase, then predicts using the learned model.

Example Algorithms:

    Linear Regression

    Logistic Regression

    Decision Trees

    Neural Networks

Key Point: Builds a general model → better at handling unseen data.

    ✅ Analogy to remember:

    Instance-based: Like a student who just memorizes past question papers and matches answers.

    Model-based: Like a student who understands the subject and can solve any new question.
