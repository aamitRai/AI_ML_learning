#ML in production
* In production Ml has two types 
1/Batch Learning  || Offline Learning
2/  Online Learning



# Batch Learning  || Offline Learning: 
  Is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on the entire dataset at once rather than incrementally. 
  It’s the traditional approach used in most classical ML algorithms.


#Key Characteristics

        *Full Dataset Required:
          The algorithm sees all the data before training starts.

        *Offline Learning:
          The model is trained offline, not updated in real-time.

        *High Computational Cost:
           Can require a lot of memory and processing power for very large datasets.

        *Stable Model:
           Once trained, the model doesn’t change until retrained with new data.

#Use Cases

    Traditional ML algorithms like Linear Regression, SVM, Decision Trees

    Image classification on a fixed dataset

    Text classification with a fixed corpus

    Financial modeling where historical data is analyzed

#Pros

    High accuracy if the dataset is clean and complete.

    Easier to implement and understand.

#Cons

    Not suitable for streaming or real-time data.

    Memory-intensive for very large datasets.

    Cannot adapt dynamically to new data without retraining.
