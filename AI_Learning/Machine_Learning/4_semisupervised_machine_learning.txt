# Semi-supervised learning :
    is a hybrid approach between supervised and unsupervised learning. It uses a small amount of labeled data along 
    with a large amount of unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy.
    It’s particularly useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming, but unlabeled data is abundant.

    ex: google photos => it ask for one photo than for that person it automatically lablled the rest photos of that person.

#Key Characteristics

    *Part of the dataset has labels, but most data is unlabeled.

    *Learns patterns from unlabeled data and uses labeled data to guide the learning.

    *Helps improve model performance compared to using only labeled data.

#How it Works

    *Train a model on the small labeled dataset.

    *Use the model to predict labels for unlabeled data (pseudo-labeling).

    *Retrain the model on the combination of labeled and pseudo-labeled data.

    *Iterate to improve accuracy.

#Common Algorithms / Techniques

    * Self-training (pseudo-labeling)

    * Graph-based methods

    * Semi-supervised SVM (S3VM)

    * Ladder networks (used in deep learning)

    * Generative models (like semi-supervised GANs)
