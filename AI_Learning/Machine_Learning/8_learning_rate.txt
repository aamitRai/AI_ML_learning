Imagine this 👇

You are walking down a hill (hill = loss function).
Your goal: reach the bottom of the hill (best solution).
Learning Rate = Step Size (how big your steps are).


#3 Cases

    a/Too Big Steps (High Learning Rate):

        You take huge jumps.

        You might overshoot the bottom and bounce back and forth.

        Sometimes you may never settle at the bottom.

    b/Too Small Steps (Low Learning Rate):

        You take baby steps.

        You will reach the bottom, but it will take a very long time.

    c/Just Right (Optimal Learning Rate):

        You take medium steps.

        You reach the bottom quickly and smoothly.
