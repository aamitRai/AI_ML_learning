# AI : is the theory and development of computer systems able to performs tasks normally requiring human intelligence.
# ML : is the sub field of AI .
     ML gives computers the ability to learn without explicit programming.
     Machine Learning is the combination of Data and Algorithm.

# Types of ML 
#1/ Unsupervised :
		*In unsupervised learning the data is not labelled.
		*Here all about the raw data. 
			Input data: x
			  |	
			Model
			  |	
			Generated
			  |	
			example

#2/ Supervised	 :
		*In supervised learning the data is labelled .
		*In supervised learing we are learning from past examples to predict the future value.
		* Model:
			Input data: x
			  |	
	-->		Model 
			  |
   ModelUpdate  	Predict output (Y)     -->compare---->  (Training dataset) Expected output (y)

		<--	Error
#4/Semi supervised : small amount of labelled and unlabelled data both used.

#3/Reinforcement learning :


#4/Deep Learning : Uses Artificial neural networks networks,which able to recognize complex patterns than traditional machine learning.


#Artificial neural network : Inspire from human brain known as biological neural network .
#biological neural network :	
			     our brain contain range from 80 billion to over 100 billion neurons.
				(nucleus, cellbody ,dendrities ,synapse ,axon )
			*Nucleus   : serves as the control center for the cell.
			*Axon	   : Axons transmit ( electrical impulses ) signals to other neurons.
			*Axon terminals : axon terminals is to transmit signals, in the form of electrical impulse located at the very end of the axon. 
			*dendrities: These are tree-like extensions from the cell body that receive signals (chemical or electrical) from other neurons and convey them toward the cell body.
			*Synapse   : The synapse is the junction between two neurons. It's a small gap where information is transmitted from one neuron to another	.
			*Cellbody  : It integrates signals received from dendrites and decides whether to transmit signals further.

#Generative AI : is the subset of Deep learning .
				is a type of artifical intelligence that create new content such as text, images, music or a code by learning patterns from existing
					data, mimicking human creativity
					
					AI->ML->DL->GenAI

#Deep learning Models : 
			1/Discriminative
		 	2/Generative

	1/Discriminative :
			* Trained on a dataset of labeled data .
			* once it learn the relationship between the features of data point and the label ,than it is able to 
			  prdeict label for new data .


	2/Generative	:
			*

# difference between AI &ML 
===============================================================================================================

GenAI  : Foundataion Model	->
		1/ User Perspective: you are using that model
		2/Builder Perspective: you are creating that model 

===============================================================================================================


In Machine Learning you never do the explicit program (like for each thing you are writting the condition)
In Machine Learning rules are generated by sytem, by analyzing the data.
