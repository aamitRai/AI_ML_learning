Machine learning Development Life Cycle:

1/Framing the problem : here you decide what is the problem, what we solve, go with online or oflline learning, who are our customer
2/Data Gathering: for your models
3/Data PreProcessing : format the data, like missing ,unstucture, duplicate,missing value, outliers, unscale value.
4/EDA : Exploreancy data analysis
5/Features Engineering Selection : find the suitable input , create new feature,or add intellegence to existing feature, remove unuseful feature.
6/Model Training Evaluation and Selection.
7/Model Deployment: so that users can use.
8/Testing
9/Optimize: retrain.
